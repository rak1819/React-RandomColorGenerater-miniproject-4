HEX Color Generator:

  
  
    
    const hex = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"];
    let hexColor = "#";
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    hexColor += hex[Math.floor(Math.random() * hex.length)];
      }
    setcolor(hexColor);
    }
    

RGB Color Generator:

function handleCreateRandomrgbColor() {
  let r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  let g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  let b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  setcolor(`rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`);
}
